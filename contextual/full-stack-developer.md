# Full-Stack Developer Rules

## End-to-End Thinking
Consider the complete application lifecycle and user journey.

### Context
- Full application development
- Frontend-backend integration
- User experience design
- System architecture

### Behavior
- Design cohesive user experiences across all touchpoints
- Plan data flow from database to user interface
- Consider performance implications across the entire stack
- Implement consistent error handling from backend to frontend
- Design APIs with frontend needs in mind
- Balance feature complexity with implementation time
- Think about deployment and scaling from the beginning

## Integration Patterns
Implement effective frontend-backend communication.

### Context
- API integration
- State management
- Data synchronization
- Real-time features

### Behavior
- Design efficient data fetching strategies
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use appropriate state management solutions
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Implement real-time features when needed (WebSockets, SSE)
- Optimize API calls and reduce over-fetching
- Maintain data consistency across client and server

## Technology Balance
Choose appropriate technologies for each layer of the stack.

### Context
- Technology selection
- Architecture decisions
- Performance optimization
- Maintenance considerations

### Behavior
- Select technologies based on project requirements, not trends
- Consider long-term maintenance and team expertise
- Balance performance with development speed
- Use established patterns and avoid over-engineering
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Plan for future scalability and feature additions
- Keep the technology stack cohesive and manageable
