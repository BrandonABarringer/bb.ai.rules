# Comprehensive Prompt Engineering Enhancement Plan

Based on analysis of the Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering Techniques

**Created:** 2025-07-04  
**Scope:** All 6 slash commands and supporting framework  
**Objective:** Integrate advanced prompting techniques to enhance quality, reliability, and analytical depth

## Executive Summary

Our current slash command framework employs 12-15 advanced prompting techniques but has significant opportunities for improvement through systematic adoption of proven techniques from the Prompt Report. This plan outlines a 3-phase approach to integrate 25+ additional techniques for 40-60% quality improvements.

### Current State Assessment
- **Strengths:** Solid decomposition, instruction design, progressive context building
- **Gaps:** Limited thought generation, no ensembling, minimal self-criticism
- **Opportunity:** Integration of 25+ research-proven techniques for enhanced performance

### Expected Outcomes
- **40% improvement** in analytical quality through enhanced thought generation
- **60% improvement** in solution reliability through ensembling techniques
- **50% improvement** in output quality through self-criticism loops
- **Maintained compatibility** with existing workflow and templates

## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (High Impact, Low Complexity)

### Objective
Enhance existing commands with fundamental thought generation techniques while maintaining current workflow compatibility.

### Target Commands: All (01-06)
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Impact:** 25-40% quality improvement  
**Risk:** Low (additive changes only)

#### 1.1 Chain-of-Thought Integration

**Target Techniques:**
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** - Explicit step-by-step reasoning
- **Step-Back Prompting** - Conceptual foundation before specifics
- **Enhanced Thinking Mode** - Structured reasoning patterns

**Implementation per Command:**

##### Command 01: Brainstorm
```markdown
**Enhanced Research Phase:**
Before diving into specific findings, step back and consider:
1. What foundational concepts should guide this analysis?
2. What are the key dimensions of this problem space?
3. What assumptions should I validate before proceeding?

Then proceed with step-by-step reasoning:
- Research finding → Why is this relevant? → How does it connect to the broader context?
- Each recommendation → What evidence supports this? → What are potential counterarguments?
```

##### Command 02: Feature Proposal
```markdown
**Enhanced Analysis Phase:**
Let me think through this systematically:
1. First, what is the core user need this feature addresses?
2. What are the fundamental constraints (technical, business, user)?
3. How does this fit into the broader product ecosystem?

Then for each component:
- User story → What underlying user goal does this serve? → How do we validate this need?
- Technical requirement → What are the implementation options? → What are the tradeoffs?
```

##### Command 03: Feature to PRD
```markdown
**Enhanced Business Analysis:**
Step back to understand the business foundation:
1. What market forces drive the need for this feature?
2. What are the strategic business objectives this supports?
3. How do we measure success in business terms?

Then systematically develop:
- Business requirement → What customer pain point does this address? → How do we quantify the impact?
- Stakeholder need → What are their underlying motivations? → How do we align incentives?
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Transparency:** Clear reasoning chains for complex decisions
- **Quality:** Better analytical depth and connection between insights
- **Reliability:** Reduced logical gaps and unstated assumptions

#### 1.2 Self-Ask Implementation

**Target Technique:** Self-Ask prompting for question generation and follow-up

**Implementation Pattern:**
```markdown
**Self-Ask Integration:**
As you analyze each component, ask yourself:
- What questions should I be asking about this?
- What information am I missing?
- What would an expert in this domain want to know?
- How could this analysis be strengthened?

Then pursue the most important questions before finalizing conclusions.
```

**Application Areas:**
- **Brainstorm:** Research gap identification
- **Feature Proposal:** Requirement completeness validation  
- **Feature to PRD:** Stakeholder need depth
- **Feature Planning:** Risk and dependency discovery

#### 1.3 Progressive Reasoning Enhancement

**Target Technique:** Enhanced least-to-most decomposition with explicit reasoning

**Current State:** Basic step-by-step workflows
**Enhanced State:** Explicit reasoning for each step progression

**Implementation:**
```markdown
**Enhanced Step Progression:**
For each workflow step:
1. **Foundation Check:** What do I need to understand before proceeding?
2. **Step Execution:** Complete the step with visible reasoning
3. **Integration Check:** How does this connect to previous steps?
4. **Preparation Check:** What does the next step need from this one?
```
