# Command 04 (feature-planning) Re-Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-07-04  
**Command:** 04_feature-planning  
**Purpose:** Re-validation using correct criteria focusing on actual deliverable quality  
**Previous Score:** Unknown - No previous validation found  
**Validation Framework:** Deliverable-focused assessment

## Executive Summary

**Re-Validation Result:** CANNOT VALIDATE - Command Not Implemented  
**Deliverable Type:** N/A  
**Assessment:** Command 04 exists only as an empty placeholder file

The feature-planning command has not been implemented. No template, validation checklist, command instructions, or execution outputs exist. This represents a gap in the workflow sequence.

## Outputs Inventory

**Total Expected:** Unknown (no template exists)  
**Found:** 0  
**Missing:** All  
**Search Locations Checked:**
- `/Users/brandonbarringer/Desktop/sites/www/rwest.ai.rules/.claude/commands/04_feature-planning.md` (empty)
- `/docs/templates/` (no feature-planning template)
- `/docs/validation-checklists/` (no feature-planning checklist)
- `/docs/outputs/sessions/` (no feature-planning outputs)

## Empty Content Check

**Result:** FAIL  
**Status:** Command file exists but is completely empty  
**File State:** 0 bytes at `.claude/commands/04_feature-planning.md`

## Implementation Status Assessment

### What Exists
1. **Empty command file** - Placeholder only
2. **Workflow references** - Other commands reference feature-planning in integration
3. **Framework categorization** - Listed as "Documentation Generator" type

### What's Missing
1. **Command instructions** - No implementation details
2. **Output template** - No structure defined
3. **Validation checklist** - No quality criteria
4. **Execution examples** - No outputs to validate
5. **Module integrations** - No extended thinking or tool usage patterns

## Workflow Impact Analysis

### Current Workflow State
```
brainstorm → feature-proposal → feature-to-prd → [GAP] → task-creation
    ✓             ✓                 ✓              ✗          ✓
```

### Integration References Found
- Feature-to-PRD outputs mention preparing for feature-planning
- Task-creation expects input from feature-planning
- Command integration guide shows it in sequence

### Implications
1. **Workflow broken** at Command 04
2. **No bridge** between PRD and task creation
3. **Planning phase** completely missing

## Comparison with Other Commands

| Command | Status | Template | Checklist | Outputs | Score |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 01_brainstorm | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Unknown |
| 02_feature-proposal | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 98/100 |
| 03_feature-to-prd | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 96/100 |
| **04_feature-planning** | **✗** | **✗** | **✗** | **✗** | **N/A** |
| 05_task-creation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 95/100 |

## Critical Findings

### 1. Complete Implementation Gap
- Command 04 is referenced throughout the framework but never implemented
- This creates a discontinuity in the idea-to-task workflow
- Users cannot complete the full workflow as designed

### 2. Validation Not Possible
- Cannot validate quality of non-existent deliverables
- Cannot assess if previous validation was correct (none exists)
- Cannot determine if command would produce useful outputs

### 3. Framework Integrity Issue
- Other commands prepare for feature-planning integration
- Task-creation expects feature-planning input
- Gap prevents full workflow execution

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Acknowledge gap** - Command 04 is unimplemented
2. **Document workaround** - Users must skip from PRD to task-creation
3. **Update workflow** - Either implement Command 04 or remove from sequence

### Implementation Options
1. **Full implementation** - Create command, template, checklist
2. **Remove from workflow** - Update other commands to skip this step
3. **Minimal bridge** - Create simple planning aggregator

### Validation Approach (If Implemented)
Since feature-planning would be a documentation generator:
- Validate planning document completeness
- Check milestone definitions
- Verify resource allocation
- Ensure task breakdown preparation

## Conclusion

**Re-Validation Result:** CANNOT VALIDATE - Command Does Not Exist

Command 04 (feature-planning) cannot be validated because it has never been implemented. This represents a significant gap in the workflow that should be addressed through either:
1. Full implementation of the command
2. Formal removal from the workflow sequence
3. Documentation of the gap with workaround instructions

**Finding:** No previous validation exists to verify. The command is simply missing from the implementation despite being referenced throughout the framework.

## Next Steps

1. **Decision Required:** Implement or formally deprecate Command 04
2. **Workflow Update:** Adjust integration points in other commands
3. **Documentation:** Update workflow guides to reflect actual state
4. **User Communication:** Inform users of the gap and workaround

This completes the re-validation of Commands 03-04. Command 03 validation was appropriate and correct (94/100). Command 04 cannot be validated as it doesn't exist.
