### ⚠️ Minor Optimization Opportunities (Non-Critical)

1. **Phase 2 Research Documentation (Brainstorm)**
   - **Current State:** Good but could be more explicit (1/2 pts lost)
   - **Impact:** -1 point on brainstorm score
   - **Recommendation:** Add explicit rationale requirements for follow-up tool calls
   - **Priority:** Low - current implementation sufficient

2. **Integration Section Detail (Both Commands)**
   - **Current State:** Good but could be more comprehensive
   - **Impact:** -2 points on brainstorm, -2 points on feature-proposal
