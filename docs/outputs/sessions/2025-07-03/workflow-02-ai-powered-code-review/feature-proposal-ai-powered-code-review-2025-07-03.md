- **Industry Standards:** DORA metrics for pipeline performance, OWASP standards for security analysis, accessibility compliance requirements, multi-platform deployment patterns

### Analysis

**Requirements Breakdown:**

1. **Functional Requirements**

   **User Stories:**
   - As a developer, I want automated code review feedback integrated into my pull request workflow so I can address issues before human review
   - As a technical lead, I want configurable rule sets aligned with team standards so the AI enforces our established practices
   - As a DevOps engineer, I want seamless CI/CD integration with minimal pipeline performance impact so deployment velocity is maintained
   - As a security engineer, I want automated vulnerability detection with remediation suggestions so security issues are caught early

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Code review analysis completes within 2 minutes for pull requests under 400 lines
   - Integration with GitHub Actions and Jenkins through standard webhook/API patterns  
   - Configurable rule sets can be updated without pipeline reconfiguration
   - Context-aware analysis references related files and dependencies within repository
   - Security vulnerability detection covers OWASP Top 10 with remediation suggestions
   - False positive rate maintained below 15% through continuous learning

   **Success Scenarios:**
   - Developer submits PR → AI analysis runs automatically → Actionable feedback provided → Developer addresses issues → Human review focuses on logic and design
   - Team updates coding standards → AI rule configuration updated → Future PRs automatically enforce new standards
   - Security vulnerability detected → AI provides specific fix recommendations → Developer implements fix → Security scan passes

   **Edge Cases:**
   - Analysis timeout for extremely large PRs (>1000 lines) with graceful degradation
   - Network connectivity issues during external AI service calls with local fallback
   - Repository access permission changes affecting context analysis with appropriate error handling
   - Conflicting rule sets from multiple team configurations with priority resolution

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**

   **Performance:**
   - Analysis completion: <2 minutes for standard PRs (<400 lines)
   - Pipeline impact: <10% increase in total build time
   - Concurrent analysis: Support 50+ simultaneous PR analyses
   - Context graph generation: <30 seconds for repositories up to 100k files

   **Security:**
   - Code analysis performed in isolated environments without data persistence
   - Repository access through standard OAuth/PAT patterns with minimal required permissions
   - AI model inference with privacy-preserving techniques (no training on customer code)
   - Audit logging for all analysis activities and rule changes

   **Accessibility:**
   - Analysis results provided in screen-reader compatible formats
   - Visual feedback includes text alternatives for color-coding
   - Command-line interface for developers with visual impairments
   - Documentation available in multiple formats (text, audio, video)

   **Compatibility:**
   - GitHub Actions integration via marketplace action
   - Jenkins integration via plugin architecture
   - GitLab CI compatibility through webhook integration
   - Support for multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go)

**Resource Assessment:**
- **Development Effort:** 16-20 weeks for MVP (CI/CD integration: 6-8 weeks, Context analysis: 8-10 weeks, Security scanning: 2-4 weeks)
- **Design Requirements:** Dashboard UI for configuration management, PR comment interface design, pipeline integration workflow design
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests for analysis engines, integration tests with major CI/CD platforms, performance testing with large repositories, security testing for data isolation
- **Documentation:** Developer onboarding guides, CI/CD integration tutorials, team configuration management, troubleshooting and FAQ

**Risk Analysis:**
- **Technical Risks:** Context graph complexity may impact performance - Mitigation: Implement caching and incremental analysis
