## Project Context
[Brief description of the project and its purpose]

**Tech Stack:**
- [List main technologies: WordPress, React, PHP, TypeScript, etc.]
- [Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.]
- [Build tools: Webpack, Vite, etc.]

## Codebase Navigation
- [Key directories and their purposes]
- [Important files to be aware of]
- [Component organization patterns]
- [Asset/style organization]

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Setup
[Installation/setup commands]

# Development
[Local development commands]

# Testing
[Test commands]

# Build/Deploy
[Build and deployment commands]
```

## Component Architecture Standards
Follow the established patterns:
- Components in dedicated folders with README.md documentation
- Container-agnostic design that responds to container size
- Self-contained with styles and functionality included
- Data-driven rather than hard-coded

## Project-Specific Rules
