## Instruction
Implement Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques in Commands 02 (Feature Proposal) and 03 (Feature to PRD) to enhance analytical depth and transparency of reasoning.

Chain-of-Thought prompting improves performance by making the reasoning process explicit and step-by-step. This is particularly valuable for complex analytical tasks like feature analysis and PRD development.

## Context
Currently, Commands 02 and 03 provide good structured output but lack explicit reasoning chains. Users receive conclusions but cannot follow the analytical path that led to those conclusions. This limits trust, makes it difficult to validate logic, and reduces learning opportunities.

## Research Foundation
Based on the Prompt Report analysis, Chain-of-Thought prompting:
- Improves performance on complex reasoning tasks by 20-40%
- Increases transparency and trust in AI-generated analysis
- Enables better debugging and refinement of reasoning
- Works particularly well for multi-step analytical processes

## Implementation Approach
Enhance both commands with explicit step-by-step reasoning patterns that maintain compatibility with existing templates while adding transparent analytical processes.

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current Command 02 (Feature Proposal) structure and identify key decision points
- [ ] Design Chain-of-Thought patterns for feature analysis (user needs → technical feasibility → business value)
- [ ] Implement CoT reasoning in Command 02 with explicit step documentation
- [ ] Test Command 02 enhanced version with existing workflows
- [ ] Analyze current Command 03 (Feature to PRD) structure and identify key decision points
- [ ] Design Chain-of-Thought patterns for PRD development (requirements → specifications → stakeholder alignment)
- [ ] Implement CoT reasoning in Command 03 with explicit step documentation
- [ ] Test Command 03 enhanced version with existing workflows
- [ ] Update module documentation to reflect CoT integration patterns
- [ ] Create examples of enhanced reasoning output for user reference
- [ ] Validate that enhanced reasoning improves analytical quality without workflow disruption

## Deliverable
Enhanced versions of Commands 02 and 03 with integrated Chain-of-Thought reasoning that:

**Command 02 Enhancements:**
- Explicit reasoning chains for user need analysis
- Step-by-step technical feasibility assessment
- Transparent business value evaluation
- Clear decision documentation throughout

**Command 03 Enhancements:**
- Explicit reasoning chains for requirement analysis
- Step-by-step stakeholder need assessment
- Transparent technical specification development
- Clear business context integration

**Quality Criteria:**
- All major analytical decisions include visible reasoning steps
- Reasoning chains are logical, complete, and easy to follow
- Enhanced commands maintain full compatibility with existing templates
- Output quality improves measurably (target: 5+ point improvement in analytical depth)
- User feedback confirms improved transparency and trust
