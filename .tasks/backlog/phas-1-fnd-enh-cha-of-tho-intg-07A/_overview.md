## Instruction
Enhance existing slash commands with fundamental thought generation techniques while maintaining current workflow compatibility. This phase focuses on integrating Chain-of-Thought, Step-Back Prompting, and Self-Ask techniques across all 6 commands.

## Objectives
- 25-40% quality improvement through enhanced reasoning
- Maintained compatibility with existing workflow and templates
- Transparent reasoning chains for complex decisions
- Better analytical depth and connection between insights

## Scope
- All 6 slash commands (01-06)
- Enhanced thinking mode with structured reasoning patterns
- Updated templates to reflect enhanced reasoning
- Updated modules for consistent reasoning patterns

## Success Criteria
- All commands demonstrate clear Chain-of-Thought reasoning
- Step-Back Prompting implemented for conceptual foundation
- Self-Ask patterns integrated for completeness validation
- Quality scores improve from 85+ to 88+ baseline
- No regression in existing functionality

## Timeline
3 weeks total with systematic rollout across all commands.

## Tasks
- [ ] Break down into subtasks
- [ ] Create subtask files
- [ ] Track progress
