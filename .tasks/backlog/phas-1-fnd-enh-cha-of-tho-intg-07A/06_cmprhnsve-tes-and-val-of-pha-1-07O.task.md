status: todo

## Instruction
Conduct comprehensive testing and validation of all Phase 1 enhancements to ensure Chain-of-Thought, Step-Back Prompting, and Self-Ask techniques are properly integrated and deliver expected quality improvements.

This is the final task of Phase 1, validating that all enhancements work together seamlessly and achieve the targeted 25-40% quality improvement without disrupting existing workflows.

## Context
Phase 1 introduces fundamental reasoning enhancements across all 6 commands. Before proceeding to Phase 2, we must validate:
- Each technique functions correctly in its target commands
- Enhanced reasoning improves output quality measurably 
- No regression in existing functionality
- Commands still chain together smoothly
- Documentation and templates support the enhancements

## Testing Scope
- Individual command testing with enhanced reasoning
- End-to-end workflow testing across all commands
- Quality metric comparison (baseline vs. enhanced)
- User experience validation
- Performance and compatibility testing

## Success Metrics
- Quality scores improve from 85+ baseline to 88+ minimum
- Reasoning transparency validated by clear decision trails
- All commands maintain workflow compatibility
- No performance degradation
- Positive user feedback on enhanced outputs

## Tasks
- [ ] Create test scenarios for each enhanced command covering typical use cases
- [ ] Run baseline tests with current commands to establish quality metrics
- [ ] Test Command 01 with Step-Back Prompting on 3 different brainstorm topics
- [ ] Test Commands 02-03 with Chain-of-Thought on 3 different features
- [ ] Test Command 04 with Step-Back Prompting on 3 different planning scenarios
- [ ] Test Commands 05-06 with Self-Ask patterns on various validation scenarios
- [ ] Execute full workflow test: brainstorm → feature-proposal → PRD → planning → task creation
- [ ] Run Command 06 validation on all enhanced command outputs
- [ ] Compare quality scores between baseline and enhanced versions
- [ ] Measure reasoning transparency using documentation clarity metrics
- [ ] Conduct performance testing to ensure no significant slowdown
- [ ] Gather user feedback through structured testing sessions
- [ ] Document all test results with evidence and metrics
- [ ] Create Phase 1 completion report with recommendations
