## Instruction
Set up and configure Redis infrastructure to support high-performance session management for the authentication system. This task involves deploying Redis in a highly available configuration, implementing proper security measures, and establishing monitoring to ensure reliable session storage for thousands of concurrent users.

Redis will serve as the primary session store for JWT refresh tokens, user session data, and temporary authentication state during OAuth flows. The configuration must support automatic failover, data persistence, and horizontal scaling to meet our performance requirements while maintaining data consistency and security.

**Key Objectives:**
- Deploy Redis in master-replica configuration with automatic failover
- Configure persistence and backup strategies for session data protection
- Implement security hardening including TLS and access controls
- Set up monitoring and alerting for Redis performance metrics

**Technical Context:**
- Redis 7.0+ with Redis Sentinel for high availability
- Deployment on AWS using ElastiCache or self-managed EC2
- Connection pooling through ioredis client library
- Prometheus metrics export for monitoring

**Constraints:**
- Maximum 10ms latency for session operations
- Support for 50,000+ concurrent sessions
- Zero data loss during failover events

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and document Redis deployment options (ElastiCache vs self-managed) with cost analysis
- [ ] Configure Redis master-replica setup with minimum 3 nodes for high availability
- [ ] Implement Redis Sentinel for automatic failover with <30 second recovery time
- [ ] Set up Redis persistence using AOF with fsync every second for durability
- [ ] Configure maxmemory policies and eviction strategies for session data
- [ ] Enable TLS encryption for all Redis connections with certificate management
- [ ] Create Redis ACL users with minimal required permissions for application access
- [ ] Set up connection pooling parameters in application configuration
- [ ] Configure Redis slow query log and monitoring metrics export
- [ ] Implement automated backup schedule with point-in-time recovery capability
- [ ] Create CloudWatch alarms for memory usage, CPU, and connection limits
- [ ] Write runbook documentation for common Redis operational tasks
- [ ] Perform load testing with 50k concurrent sessions to validate configuration
- [ ] Set up Redis CLI access with secure bastion host for troubleshooting

## Deliverable
Production-ready Redis infrastructure configured for high-availability session management with comprehensive monitoring and operational documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Redis cluster supports 50,000+ concurrent sessions
- All operations complete in <10ms at p99 latency
- Automatic failover completes in <30 seconds
- Zero data loss during planned maintenance
- Monitoring dashboards show real-time performance metrics

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Redis cluster deployed and tested in production
- [ ] All security measures implemented and verified
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting fully operational
- [ ] Load tests pass performance requirements
- [ ] Runbook reviewed by operations team
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
