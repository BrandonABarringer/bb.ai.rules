## Instruction
Test context adaptation and creative insight quality across diverse domains and scenarios to validate that Phase 3 advanced techniques deliver the targeted 30-50% innovation improvements.

This comprehensive testing validates that Self-Generated ICL, Analogical Prompting, and Chain-of-Verification work together to create adaptive, innovative, and accurate outputs across varied contexts.

## Context
Phase 3 introduces sophisticated adaptation and verification capabilities:
- Self-Generated ICL for context-specific examples
- Analogical Prompting for cross-domain innovation
- Chain-of-Verification for systematic accuracy

We must validate:
- Context adaptation works across domains
- Creative insights genuinely innovative
- Verification maintains accuracy
- Techniques complement rather than interfere

## Testing Scope
- Cross-domain adaptation testing
- Creative insight quality measurement
- Innovation breakthrough assessment
- Verification accuracy validation
- User experience across diverse contexts

## Success Metrics
- Self-Generated ICL: 90%+ context relevance
- Analogical Prompting: 45%+ creativity increase
- Chain-of-Verification: 60%+ error reduction
- Combined: 30-50% innovation improvement
- User satisfaction across domains
- Maintained accuracy with enhanced creativity
