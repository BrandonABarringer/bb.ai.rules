## Instruction
Add Analogical Prompting to the brainstorm command to enhance creative insight generation through cross-domain pattern recognition and innovative solution discovery.

Analogical Prompting leverages cross-domain analogies to spark creative insights and novel solutions. By examining how similar problems were solved in different fields, this technique dramatically enhances ideation quality and innovation potential.

## Context
Command 01 (Brainstorm) currently focuses on direct research and analysis within the target domain. While effective for incremental improvements, it often misses:
- Revolutionary insights from other domains
- Proven patterns from adjacent industries
- Creative connections between disparate fields
- Innovative approaches from nature or science
- Breakthrough solutions that transcend domain boundaries

## Research Foundation
Based on the Prompt Report, Analogical Prompting:
- Increases creative insight generation by 45-60%
- Improves solution novelty and breakthrough potential
- Enhances problem-solving by leveraging proven patterns
- Particularly effective for complex, multi-faceted challenges
- Works synergistically with Step-Back Prompting from Phase 1

## Implementation Approach
Enhance Command 01 with systematic analogical analysis:
1. Identify core problem patterns and constraints
2. Search for analogous challenges in different domains
3. Extract transferable principles and solutions
4. Adapt insights to target context
5. Validate analogical reasoning quality
