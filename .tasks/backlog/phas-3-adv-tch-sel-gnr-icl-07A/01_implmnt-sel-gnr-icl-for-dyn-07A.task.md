## Instruction
Implement Self-Generated In-Context Learning (ICL) to enable dynamic example generation based on context, enhancing the framework's adaptability across different domains and use cases.

Self-Generated ICL is an advanced technique where the AI dynamically creates relevant examples tailored to the specific context, rather than relying on static, pre-defined examples. This dramatically improves performance on novel or specialized tasks.

## Context
Current commands use implicit few-shot learning through templates but lack:
- Context-specific example generation
- Domain adaptation capabilities
- Dynamic demonstration selection
- Task-specific learning patterns
- Adaptive complexity adjustment

## Research Foundation
Based on the Prompt Report, Self-Generated ICL:
- Improves task performance by 35-50% on novel domains
- Reduces need for manual example curation
- Enables rapid adaptation to new contexts
- Particularly effective for specialized or technical domains
- Synergizes with existing reasoning enhancements

## Implementation Approach
Enhance all commands with dynamic example generation that:
1. Analyzes task context and domain
2. Generates relevant, high-quality examples
3. Adapts complexity to match requirements
4. Validates example quality before use
5. Learns from generated examples for future tasks

## Tasks
- [ ] Design context analysis framework for example relevance determination
- [ ] Create example generation templates for different task types
- [ ] Implement domain detection for specialized example needs
- [ ] Build quality validation for generated examples
- [ ] Design complexity adaptation based on task requirements
- [ ] Implement example storage for cross-session learning
- [ ] Create example generation for brainstorming contexts
- [ ] Create example generation for feature proposal contexts
- [ ] Create example generation for PRD development contexts
- [ ] Create example generation for project planning contexts
- [ ] Create example generation for task creation contexts
- [ ] Create example generation for validation contexts
- [ ] Test across 10 different domains measuring adaptation quality
- [ ] Validate performance improvements on novel tasks
- [ ] Document Self-Generated ICL patterns and guidelines
