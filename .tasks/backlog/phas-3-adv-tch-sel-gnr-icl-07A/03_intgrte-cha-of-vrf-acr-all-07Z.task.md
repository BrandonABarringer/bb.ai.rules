## Instruction
Integrate Chain-of-Verification (CoV) across all commands to enable systematic fact-checking and claim validation, ensuring information accuracy and reducing hallucination risks.

Chain-of-Verification is an advanced self-criticism technique that systematically verifies claims, facts, and assertions through structured questioning and evidence validation. This creates a robust quality assurance layer across the entire workflow.

## Context
All commands currently make factual claims, technical assertions, and recommendations without systematic verification. This creates risks of:
- Factual inaccuracies in research and analysis
- Unvalidated technical claims in specifications
- Unsupported business assertions in proposals
- Incorrect assumptions in planning
- Inadequate evidence for recommendations

## Research Foundation
Based on the Prompt Report, Chain-of-Verification:
- Reduces factual errors by 60-70%
- Improves information reliability significantly
- Enhances user trust through transparent verification
- Particularly effective for technical and business content
- Works synergistically with Self-Consistency and Self-Refine

## Implementation Approach
Implement systematic verification across all commands:
1. Claim identification and categorization
2. Evidence requirement specification
3. Verification question generation
4. Evidence gathering and validation
5. Confidence scoring and uncertainty handling
6. Corrective action for unverified claims

## Tasks
- [ ] Design claim identification system for different content types
- [ ] Create verification question templates by claim category
- [ ] Implement evidence gathering mechanisms for fact-checking
- [ ] Build confidence scoring system for verified claims
- [ ] Design uncertainty handling for unverifiable assertions
- [ ] Create corrective action framework for false claims
- [ ] Integrate CoV with Command 01 (Brainstorm) for research validation
- [ ] Integrate CoV with Command 02 (Feature Proposal) for feasibility verification
- [ ] Integrate CoV with Command 03 (PRD) for specification validation
- [ ] Integrate CoV with Command 04 (Planning) for assumption verification
- [ ] Integrate CoV with Command 05 (Task Creation) for accuracy validation
- [ ] Integrate CoV with Command 06 (Validation) for meta-verification
- [ ] Test verification effectiveness across 25 outputs
- [ ] Measure error reduction and accuracy improvements
- [ ] Validate user trust and confidence improvements
- [ ] Document Chain-of-Verification patterns and implementation guide

## Deliverable
Framework-wide Chain-of-Verification implementation ensuring systematic accuracy:

**Core Implementation:**
1. **Claim Detection System**
   - Factual claim identification
   - Technical assertion detection
   - Business assumption recognition
   - Recommendation support requirements

2. **Verification Engine**
   - Systematic question generation
   - Evidence gathering protocols
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Source reliability assessment

3. **Command-Specific Integration**
   - **Brainstorm**: Research fact verification
   - **Feature Proposal**: Technical feasibility validation
   - **PRD**: Specification accuracy checking
   - **Planning**: Assumption and timeline verification
   - **Task Creation**: Requirement accuracy validation
   - **Validation**: Meta-verification of verification quality

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Confidence scoring for all claims
   - Uncertainty flags for unverifiable content
   - Corrective recommendations
   - Evidence trail documentation

**Quality Criteria:**
- 60%+ reduction in factual errors

- Confidence scores accurate and helpful
- User trust measurably improved
- No significant performance degradation

**Files to be delivered:**
- All 6 command files enhanced with Chain-of-Verification
- `docs/modules/chain-of-verification.md` (new)
- Verification templates and question banks
- Evidence gathering protocols
- Accuracy improvement metrics
- User trust validation results
