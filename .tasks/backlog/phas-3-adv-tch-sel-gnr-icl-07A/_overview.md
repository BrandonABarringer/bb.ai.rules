## Instruction
Implement sophisticated techniques for creative and adaptive capabilities. This phase focuses on Self-Generated In-Context Learning for dynamic examples, Analogical Prompting for cross-domain insights, and Chain-of-Verification for systematic fact-checking.

## Objectives
- 30-50% innovation and adaptability improvement
- Context-adaptive example generation capabilities
- Cross-domain insight and creative solution generation
- Systematic verification and fact-checking integration

## Scope
- Framework-wide enhancement across all commands
- Dynamic example generation based on context
- Cross-domain analogical analysis capabilities
- Comprehensive verification chains for all claims

## Success Criteria
- Self-Generated ICL demonstrates context-appropriate examples
- Analogical Prompting generates valuable cross-domain insights
- Chain-of-Verification shows systematic claim validation
- Innovation metrics show increased creative solution generation
- Adaptability across different domains and complexity levels
