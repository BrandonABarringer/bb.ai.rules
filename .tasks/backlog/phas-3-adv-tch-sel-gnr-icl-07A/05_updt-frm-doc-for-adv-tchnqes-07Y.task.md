---
type: feature
status: todo
area: prompt-engineering
---


## Instruction
Update framework documentation to comprehensively cover all advanced techniques from Phases 1-3, creating definitive guides for Self-Generated ICL, Analogical Prompting, and Chain-of-Verification integration.

With Phase 3 completion, the framework includes 8+ advanced prompting techniques. Documentation must provide clear implementation guidance, usage patterns, and integration strategies for the complete enhanced system.

## Context
The framework now includes sophisticated prompting techniques:
- **Phase 1**: Chain-of-Thought, Step-Back Prompting, Self-Ask
- **Phase 2**: Self-Consistency, Self-Refine, DiVeRSe
- **Phase 3**: Self-Generated ICL, Analogical Prompting, Chain-of-Verification

Documentation must:
- Provide comprehensive implementation guides
- Show technique integration patterns
- Include best practices and examples
- Support new users and advanced practitioners

## Requirements
Update all framework documentation:
- Module documentation for each technique
- Integration guides showing technique combinations
- User guides for different skill levels
- Troubleshooting and optimization guides
- Complete API reference for all enhancements

## Design Principles
- Progressive complexity: Basic to advanced usage
- Practical examples: Real scenarios with outcomes
- Clear integration: How techniques work together
- Performance guidance: Optimization recommendations

## Tasks
- [ ] Update master framework documentation with complete technique catalog
- [ ] Create comprehensive Self-Generated ICL implementation guide
- [ ] Create detailed Analogical Prompting usage patterns documentation
- [ ] Create Chain-of-Verification integration guide with examples
- [ ] Update thinking-mode module with all Phase 3 patterns
- [ ] Create technique combination guide showing synergistic patterns
- [ ] Update command documentation with all enhancement references
- [ ] Create performance optimization guide for all techniques
