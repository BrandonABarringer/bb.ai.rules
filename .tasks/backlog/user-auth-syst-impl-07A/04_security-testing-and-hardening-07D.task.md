## Instruction
Conduct comprehensive security testing and implement hardening measures for the authentication system to ensure it meets enterprise security standards and protects against common attack vectors. This task involves both automated and manual security testing, vulnerability assessment, and implementation of additional security controls based on findings.

The security testing must cover all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, with particular focus on authentication and session management risks. We'll perform penetration testing, code security analysis, and configuration reviews to identify potential weaknesses. Based on findings, we'll implement security hardening measures and establish ongoing security monitoring practices.

**Key Objectives:**
- Perform comprehensive security assessment of all authentication components
- Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities
- Implement additional security controls and monitoring
- Achieve compliance with security standards (SOC 2, OWASP)

**Technical Context:**
- OWASP ZAP for automated security scanning
- Burp Suite for manual penetration testing
- SonarQube for static code analysis
- AWS Security Hub for cloud security posture
- Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning

**Constraints:**
- Zero high-severity vulnerabilities in production
- Security testing must not impact production systems
- Maintain performance while adding security controls

## Tasks
- [ ] Configure and run OWASP ZAP automated security scan on all endpoints
- [ ] Perform manual penetration testing focusing on authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in all database queries
- [ ] Verify XSS protection in all user input fields and API responses
- [ ] Test CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- [ ] Validate JWT implementation for token forgery and replay attacks
- [ ] Audit password policies and test for weak password acceptance
- [ ] Verify rate limiting effectiveness against brute force attacks
- [ ] Test session management for fixation and hijacking vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review and test OAuth implementation for authorization flaws
- [ ] Perform dependency scanning and update vulnerable packages
- [ ] Implement additional WAF rules based on attack patterns found
- [ ] Configure security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] Set up real-time security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create security runbook for incident response
- [ ] Conduct security training for development team
- [ ] Document all findings and remediation steps
- [ ] Schedule external security audit for validation

## Deliverable
Hardened authentication system with comprehensive security assessment report, remediation documentation, and ongoing security monitoring.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Zero high or critical vulnerabilities in final scan
- All OWASP Top 10 categories tested and passed
- Security monitoring detecting and alerting on attacks
- Penetration test report with all findings remediated
- SOC 2 compliance requirements met

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All security tests completed and passed
- [ ] Vulnerabilities remediated and retested
- [ ] Security monitoring operational
- [ ] Security documentation complete
- [ ] External audit scheduled
- [ ] Team security training completed
