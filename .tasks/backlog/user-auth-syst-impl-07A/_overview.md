## Instruction
Implement a comprehensive user authentication system for our web application that provides secure login, registration, and session management capabilities. This feature is critical for protecting user data and enabling personalized experiences across the platform.

The authentication system will utilize industry-standard security practices including bcrypt password hashing, JWT tokens for session management, and OAuth 2.0 integration for social login providers. The implementation will follow OWASP security guidelines and include protection against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.

**Technical Architecture:**
The system will be built using Node.js with Express framework for the backend API, PostgreSQL for user data persistence, and Redis for session storage. Frontend integration will support both traditional web forms and modern SPA frameworks through a RESTful API design.

**Success Metrics:**
- Authentication response time under 200ms for 95% of requests
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent authenticated sessions
- Zero security vulnerabilities in OWASP Top 10 categories
- 99.9% uptime for authentication services

**Subtask Breakdown:**
1. Database Schema and User Model Design: Create robust data models for user accounts, roles, and permissions
2. Authentication API Implementation: Build secure endpoints for registration, login, and token management
3. Frontend Integration and UI Components: Develop reusable authentication forms and session management
4. Security Testing and Hardening: Comprehensive security audit and penetration testing

**Dependencies and Risks:**
- Requires coordination with DevOps team for Redis deployment
- Integration with existing user data migration needed
- Performance testing required under load conditions
- Security review by external auditor recommended
