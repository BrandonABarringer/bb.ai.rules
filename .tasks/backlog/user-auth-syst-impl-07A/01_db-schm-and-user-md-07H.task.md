## Instruction
Design and implement the database schema for the user authentication system, establishing a robust foundation for secure user data storage and efficient query performance. This task involves creating PostgreSQL tables, indexes, and relationships that will support user accounts, roles, permissions, and audit trails while maintaining data integrity and security best practices.

The schema must accommodate future scaling requirements, supporting millions of user records while maintaining sub-millisecond query performance for authentication operations. We'll implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system that allows flexible permission management and supports multi-tenancy requirements for enterprise customers.

**Key Objectives:**
- Design normalized database schema following PostgreSQL best practices
- Implement secure storage for sensitive user data with appropriate encryption
- Create efficient indexes for authentication query optimization
- Establish audit trail mechanism for security compliance

**Technical Context:**
- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgcrypto extension for encryption
- Connection pooling via PgBouncer for performance
- Read replicas for scaling authentication queries
- Point-in-time recovery enabled for data protection

**Constraints:**
- GDPR compliance required for EU user data
- Password history must be maintained for security policy
- Schema changes must support zero-downtime migrations

## Tasks
- [ ] Research current user tables and identify migration requirements from legacy system
- [ ] Design normalized schema for users, roles, permissions, and sessions tables
- [ ] Create ERD diagram documenting all tables, relationships, and constraints
- [ ] Implement users table with encrypted password storage using pgcrypto
- [ ] Design roles and permissions tables supporting hierarchical RBAC model
- [ ] Create user_sessions table with automatic expiration via PostgreSQL triggers
- [ ] Implement audit_log table capturing all authentication events with timestamps
- [ ] Add indexes on email, username, and session token fields for query optimization
- [ ] Create database migrations using Flyway or similar versioning tool
- [ ] Write seed data scripts for development and testing environments
- [ ] Document schema design decisions and query optimization strategies
- [ ] Implement database backup and recovery procedures

## Deliverable
Production-ready PostgreSQL database schema supporting secure user authentication with comprehensive documentation and migration scripts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Schema supports 1M+ user records with <5ms query performance
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest using AES-256
- RBAC implementation supports unlimited roles and granular permissions
- Audit trail captures 100% of authentication events
- Zero-downtime migration path from existing user tables

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Schema implemented in development database
- [ ] All tables have appropriate constraints and indexes
- [ ] Migration scripts tested and versioned
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Security review completed by DBA team
- [ ] Documentation approved by architecture team
