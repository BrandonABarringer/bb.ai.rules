# Authentication API Implementation

## Instruction
Implement the core authentication API endpoints that will handle user registration, login, logout, and session management for the application. This RESTful API will serve as the backbone of our authentication system, providing secure, performant, and scalable authentication services that can be consumed by web, mobile, and third-party applications.

The API implementation must follow security best practices including input validation, rate limiting, and proper error handling to prevent information leakage. We'll use JWT tokens for stateless authentication while maintaining refresh tokens in Redis for session management. The API will support both traditional username/password authentication and OAuth 2.0 social login providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft).

**Key Objectives:**
- Build secure REST endpoints for all authentication operations
- Implement JWT token generation and validation with refresh token rotation
- Add OAuth 2.0 integration for major social providers
- Ensure all endpoints are protected against common attack vectors

**Technical Context:**
- Node.js 18+ with Express.js framework
- Passport.js for authentication strategies
- Redis for session and refresh token storage
- Rate limiting via express-rate-limit
- API documentation with OpenAPI 3.0 specification

**Constraints:**
- All endpoints must respond within 200ms at p95
- Support 1000+ concurrent authentication requests
- Maintain backward compatibility with v1 API during migration

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Express.js project structure with TypeScript and proper error handling middleware
- [ ] Implement POST /api/auth/register endpoint with email verification workflow
- [ ] Create POST /api/auth/login endpoint with bcrypt password validation
- [ ] Build POST /api/auth/logout endpoint to invalidate tokens and clear sessions
- [ ] Implement POST /api/auth/refresh endpoint for JWT token rotation
- [ ] Add GET /api/auth/verify-email endpoint for email confirmation flow
- [ ] Create POST /api/auth/forgot-password and POST /api/auth/reset-password endpoints
- [ ] Integrate Passport.js strategies for Google, GitHub, and Microsoft OAuth
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all endpoints (5 requests per minute for auth endpoints)
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation using Joi or express-validator
- [ ] Create middleware for JWT token validation and user context injection
- [ ] Implement API versioning strategy with proper routing
- [ ] Write OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs for debugging
- [ ] Create integration tests covering all authentication flows

## Deliverable
Production-ready authentication API with comprehensive endpoint coverage, security hardening, and full documentation ready for frontend integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All endpoints respond in <200ms for 95% of requests
- 100% of endpoints have input validation and rate limiting
- OAuth integration working for all three providers
- API documentation automatically generated from OpenAPI spec
- Zero high-severity vulnerabilities in security scan

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All endpoints implemented and passing tests
- [ ] Security review completed with no critical issues
- [ ] API documentation published and reviewed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet SLA requirements
- [ ] Integration tests achieve 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Deployment pipeline configured with health checks
