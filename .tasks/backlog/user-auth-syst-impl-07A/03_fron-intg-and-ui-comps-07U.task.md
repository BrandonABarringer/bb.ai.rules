## Instruction
Develop the frontend authentication components and integrate them with the authentication API to provide a seamless user experience across web and mobile platforms. This task involves creating reusable React components for login, registration, password reset, and session management that can be easily integrated into any application layout.

The frontend implementation must handle all authentication flows gracefully, including error states, loading indicators, and success feedback. We'll implement secure token storage, automatic token refresh, and proper session timeout handling. The components should support both traditional form-based authentication and social login providers with a consistent user interface.

**Key Objectives:**
- Build reusable React components for all authentication flows
- Implement secure client-side token management
- Create responsive designs that work across devices
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Technical Context:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for API communication with interceptors
- React Hook Form for form validation
- React Query for server state management

**Constraints:**
- Components must be framework-agnostic (exportable)
- Support for both SPA and SSR environments
- Maintain consistency with existing design system

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up React component library structure with TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Create LoginForm component with email/password fields and validation
- [ ] Implement RegistrationForm with password strength indicator and terms acceptance
- [ ] Build PasswordResetFlow component with email verification step
- [ ] Develop SocialLoginButtons component for OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
- [ ] Create SessionManager component for token storage and refresh logic
- [ ] Implement ProtectedRoute wrapper for authenticated-only pages
- [ ] Add UserProfileMenu component with logout and account settings
- [ ] Build EmailVerification component for confirmation flow
- [ ] Create comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Implement loading states and skeleton screens during API calls
- [ ] Add accessibility features including ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Create Storybook stories for all components with various states
- [ ] Write unit tests for all components with React Testing Library
- [ ] Implement E2E tests for complete authentication flows using Cypress

## Deliverable
Production-ready React component library for authentication with comprehensive documentation, tests, and Storybook showcase.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All components render correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Forms validate input and display appropriate error messages
- Token refresh happens automatically without user intervention
- Components meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- 90%+ test coverage for all components

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All components implemented and tested
- [ ] Storybook documentation complete
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms render)
- [ ] Code review approved by frontend team
- [ ] Integration tests with API passing
