## Instruction
Implement ensembling and self-criticism techniques for improved reliability and quality assurance. This phase focuses on Self-Consistency with multiple reasoning paths, Self-Refine iterative improvement, and enhanced validation with DiVeRSe techniques.

## Objectives
- 40-60% reliability improvement through ensembling techniques
- Enhanced quality through iterative improvement loops
- Multiple reasoning path validation for critical decisions
- Systematic verification and consistency checking

## Scope
- Commands 02, 03, 04 (core analytical commands)
- Enhanced validation framework (Command 06)
- Multi-path analysis implementation
- Iterative refinement processes

## Success Criteria
- Self-Consistency implemented with 3+ reasoning paths per critical decision
- Self-Refine loops demonstrate measurable quality improvement
- DiVeRSe verification shows comprehensive validation coverage
- Quality scores improve to 90+ with enhanced reliability metrics
- Consistency across different topics and complexity levels

## Timeline
4 weeks with focus on core analytical commands first, then framework enhancement.

## Tasks
- [ ] Break down into subtasks
- [ ] Create subtask files
- [ ] Track progress

## Deliverable
