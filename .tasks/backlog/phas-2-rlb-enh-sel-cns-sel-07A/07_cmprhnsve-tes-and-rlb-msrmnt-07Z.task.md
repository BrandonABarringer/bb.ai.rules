## Instruction
Conduct comprehensive testing and reliability measurement of all Phase 2 enhancements to validate that Self-Consistency, Self-Refine, and DiVeRSe techniques deliver the targeted 40-60% reliability improvements.

This is the final task of Phase 2, validating that reliability enhancements work together effectively and achieve significant quality improvements while maintaining system performance.

## Context
Phase 2 introduces sophisticated reliability techniques:
- Self-Consistency with multiple reasoning paths
- Self-Refine with iterative improvement loops
- DiVeRSe with multi-verifier validation
- Enhanced templates capturing multi-path data

We must validate:
- Each technique delivers promised improvements
- Techniques work synergistically
- System remains performant
- Users benefit from enhanced reliability

## Testing Scope
- Individual technique validation
- Combined technique effectiveness
- End-to-end workflow reliability
- Performance impact assessment
- User experience validation

## Success Metrics
- Self-Consistency: 40%+ reliability improvement
- Self-Refine: 30%+ quality improvement per iteration
- DiVeRSe: 60%+ more issues detected
- Combined: 90+ quality scores consistently
- Performance: Under 50% overhead
- User satisfaction: Significant improvement

## Tasks
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for reliability measurements
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics with Phase 1 enhanced commands
- [ ] Test Self-Consistency on 10 features across Commands 02-04
- [ ] Measure reasoning path convergence and divergence patterns
- [ ] Test Self-Refine iterations on 15 documents measuring quality progression
- [ ] Validate stopping criteria effectiveness for refinement loops
- [ ] Test DiVeRSe validation on 20 outputs measuring issue detection rates
- [ ] Analyze verifier agreement patterns and false positive rates
- [ ] Execute 5 complete workflows with all enhancements active
- [ ] Measure end-to-end reliability improvements
- [ ] Conduct performance testing measuring execution time impact
- [ ] Run user testing sessions for enhanced output evaluation
- [ ] Compare Phase 2 outputs against baseline and Phase 1
- [ ] Document all metrics with statistical confidence intervals
- [ ] Create Phase 2 completion report with recommendations
