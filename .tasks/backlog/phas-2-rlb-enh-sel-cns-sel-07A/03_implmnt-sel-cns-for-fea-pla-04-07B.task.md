## Instruction
Implement Self-Consistency prompting for Command 04 (Feature Planning) to enhance project planning reliability through multiple planning perspectives and risk-aware synthesis.

Feature Planning is where abstract requirements become concrete project plans. Self-Consistency ensures these plans are robust, realistic, and comprehensive by examining them through multiple lenses: resource optimization, risk management, and timeline feasibility.

## Context
Command 04 creates detailed project plans including work breakdown structures, resource allocation, and timelines. Current single-perspective planning often results in:
- Overly optimistic timelines
- Underestimated resource needs
- Hidden dependencies and risks
- Inadequate buffer for unknowns
- Missing critical path analysis

## Research Foundation
Self-Consistency for project planning leverages:
- Multiple estimation techniques for accurate timelines
- Different risk assessment perspectives
- Resource allocation validation across constraints
- Dependency analysis from various viewpoints
- Buffer calculation through uncertainty quantification

## Implementation Approach
Implement three specialized planning paths:
1. Optimistic path: Best-case scenario with ideal conditions
2. Realistic path: Expected case with typical challenges
3. Conservative path: Risk-adjusted with comprehensive buffers

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze Command 04 planning workflow and estimation points
- [ ] Design Optimistic planning path with ideal assumptions
- [ ] Design Realistic planning path with typical project factors
- [ ] Design Conservative planning path with risk buffers
- [ ] Implement parallel timeline generation for each path
- [ ] Create resource allocation analysis across paths
- [ ] Build dependency identification from multiple viewpoints
- [ ] Implement risk synthesis from path divergence
- [ ] Create confidence intervals for timeline estimates
- [ ] Design critical path visualization across scenarios
- [ ] Add planning rationale documentation for each path
- [ ] Test with 5 projects of varying size and complexity
- [ ] Measure planning accuracy improvement metrics
- [ ] Validate risk identification completeness
- [ ] Document Self-Consistency patterns for project planning

## Deliverable
Enhanced Command 04 with Self-Consistency implementation providing:

**Core Enhancements:**
1. **Triple-Path Planning Analysis**
   - Optimistic: Best-case timelines and resources
   - Realistic: Expected case with normal variance
   - Conservative: Risk-buffered comprehensive plan
   - Independent estimation preventing anchoring bias

2. **Planning Synthesis**
   - Timeline confidence intervals from path analysis
   - Resource needs with min/expected/max ranges
   - Risk identification from divergence patterns
   - Critical path consensus across scenarios

3. **Output Enhancements**
   - Three-point estimates for all timelines
   - Risk-adjusted resource allocation
   - Confidence levels for milestones
   - Contingency planning from divergence

**Quality Criteria:**
- Timeline estimates include confidence ranges
- Resource allocation validated across paths
- All major risks identified and quantified
- Dependencies comprehensive across viewpoints
- Planning accuracy improved by 50%+
- Reduced project overruns in execution

**Files to be delivered:**
- `.claude/commands/04_feature-planning.md` (enhanced with Self-Consistency)
- Planning-specific Self-Consistency patterns documentation
- `docs/templates/feature-planning-output-template.md` (multi-path update)
- Test project plans with three-point estimates
- Accuracy improvement metrics and validation data
