## Instruction
Implement Self-Consistency prompting for Command 03 (Feature to PRD) to enhance PRD reliability through multiple analytical perspectives and stakeholder-aware synthesis.

Building on Phase 2's reliability focus, this task implements Self-Consistency in PRD generation to ensure comprehensive stakeholder consideration, technical accuracy, and business alignment through multiple independent reasoning paths.

## Context
Command 03 transforms feature proposals into Product Requirements Documents. PRDs are critical documents that guide engineering teams, inform stakeholders, and define success criteria. Current single-path generation risks:
- Overlooking stakeholder perspectives
- Technical specification gaps
- Misaligned business objectives
- Incomplete acceptance criteria

## Research Foundation
Self-Consistency for PRD generation leverages:
- Multiple stakeholder viewpoints for comprehensive requirements
- Technical/business/user trichotomy for balanced specifications
- Consensus building for critical requirements
- Divergence identification for risk areas

## Implementation Approach
Enhance Command 03 with three specialized reasoning paths:
1. Product path: User needs, market positioning, success metrics
2. Engineering path: Technical architecture, implementation details, constraints
3. Stakeholder path: Cross-functional requirements, dependencies, communication needs

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze Command 03 PRD generation workflow and decision points
- [ ] Design Product reasoning path focusing on user value and market fit
- [ ] Design Engineering reasoning path for technical specifications
- [ ] Design Stakeholder reasoning path for cross-functional alignment
- [ ] Implement parallel generation for requirements analysis
- [ ] Create synthesis mechanism for requirement prioritization
- [ ] Build consensus detection for critical specifications
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution for divergent requirements
- [ ] Add multi-path documentation to PRD sections
- [ ] Create stakeholder alignment matrix from path synthesis
- [ ] Test with 5 different feature types (API, UI, infrastructure, etc.)
- [ ] Measure completeness improvement across stakeholder needs
- [ ] Validate technical specification accuracy increases
- [ ] Document Self-Consistency patterns for PRD generation

## Deliverable
Enhanced Command 03 with Self-Consistency implementation delivering:

**Core Enhancements:**
1. **Triple-Path PRD Analysis**
   - Product path: Market fit, user value, success metrics
   - Engineering path: Architecture, implementation, testing
   - Stakeholder path: Dependencies, communication, alignment
   - Independent generation preventing bias

2. **Requirements Synthesis**
   - Consensus-based requirement prioritization
   - Conflict identification and resolution
   - Completeness validation across paths
   - Risk area highlighting from divergence

3. **PRD Enhancements**
   - Multi-perspective requirement rationale
   - Stakeholder alignment visualization
   - Confidence scoring for specifications
   - Gap analysis from path divergence

**Quality Criteria:**
- All stakeholder perspectives represented
- Technical specifications comprehensive and accurate
- Business objectives clearly aligned
- Requirement conflicts explicitly resolved
- PRD completeness improved by 45%+
- Stakeholder satisfaction increased

**Files to be delivered:**
- `.claude/commands/03_feature-to-prd.md` (enhanced with Self-Consistency)
- Updated Self-Consistency patterns in module documentation
- `docs/templates/feature-to-prd-output-template.md` (multi-path update)
- Test PRDs showing comprehensive stakeholder coverage
- Metrics demonstrating completeness improvements
