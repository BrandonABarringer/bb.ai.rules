## Instruction
Enhance Command 06 (Validation Framework) with DiVeRSe (Diverse Verifier on Reasoning Steps) multi-verifier approach to create comprehensive, multi-perspective validation that catches more quality issues.

DiVeRSe validation uses multiple independent verification perspectives to systematically assess output quality. This ensemble approach to validation significantly improves error detection and quality assessment accuracy.

## Context
Command 06 currently uses a single validation perspective based on command type (Documentation Generator vs. Artifact Creator). While effective, this approach may miss:
- Domain-specific quality issues
- Cross-functional requirement gaps
- Subtle logical inconsistencies
- User experience problems
- Integration compatibility issues

## Research Foundation
DiVeRSe validation leverages:
- Multiple verification perspectives reduce blind spots
- Ensemble validation catches 60%+ more issues
- Specialized verifiers for different quality dimensions
- Consensus mechanisms for accurate quality scoring
- Divergence analysis highlights problematic areas

## Implementation Approach
Implement five specialized verifiers:
1. Content Verifier: Completeness, accuracy, depth
2. Technical Verifier: Correctness, feasibility, best practices
3. User Verifier: Clarity, usability, actionability
4. Process Verifier: Workflow compliance, integration readiness
5. Quality Verifier: Professional standards, consistency, polish

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current validation framework structure and scoring system
- [ ] Design Content Verifier for completeness and accuracy validation
- [ ] Design Technical Verifier for correctness and implementation quality
- [ ] Design User Verifier for clarity and actionability assessment
- [ ] Design Process Verifier for workflow and integration validation
- [ ] Design Quality Verifier for professional standards assessment
- [ ] Implement parallel verification execution framework
- [ ] Create consensus mechanism for final quality scoring
- [ ] Build divergence analysis to identify problem areas
- [ ] Design verifier-specific evidence collection templates
- [ ] Implement visual validation report with multi-verifier results
- [ ] Add confidence scoring based on verifier agreement
- [ ] Test on 20 outputs across all 6 commands
- [ ] Measure issue detection improvement over single verifier
- [ ] Optimize verifier set for coverage vs. efficiency
- [ ] Document DiVeRSe patterns for different command types

## Deliverable
Enhanced Command 06 with DiVeRSe multi-verifier validation:

**Core Implementation:**
1. **Five-Verifier System**
   - Content: Completeness, accuracy, evidence quality
