# Comprehensive Feature-Proposal Validation

---
type: feature
status: done
area: command-validation
---


## Instruction
Conduct comprehensive validation of the feature-proposal command execution using the existing feature-proposal-command-validation-checklist.txt to determine if our improvements successfully raised the score from the original 70/100 failure.

This validation is the critical success measure for our entire improvement effort. The goal is to achieve 85+/100 score demonstrating that our targeted standardization resolved the original validation gaps.

The validation must be thorough and objective, documenting both successes and any remaining gaps.

## Tasks
**GIT FLOW SETUP:**
- [ ] Continue on testing/task-03-enhanced-feature-proposal branch
- [ ] Verify feature-proposal output is ready for validation
- [ ] Update Scopecraft task with validation approach

**COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION:**
- [ ] Access feature-proposal-command-validation-checklist.txt from project root
- [ ] Execute complete step-by-step validation against all checklist criteria:
  - [ ] Command Input Validation
  - [ ] Step-by-Step Execution Validation (all 7 steps)
  - [ ] Brainstorm Integration Validation
  - [ ] Template Compliance Validation
  - [ ] Feasibility Matrix Validation
  - [ ] Tool Usage Validation
  - [ ] Module Reference Validation
  - [ ] Output File Validation
  - [ ] Workflow Integration Validation
  - [ ] Expected Outcomes Validation
- [ ] Calculate scoring using the 100-point system:
  - [ ] Process Compliance (25 points)
  - [ ] Module Integration (20 points)
  - [ ] Research Quality (25 points)
  - [ ] Output Quality (30 points)
- [ ] Compare final score against original 70/100 baseline
- [ ] Identify specific improvements that contributed to score increase
- [ ] Document any remaining critical failure points
- [ ] Assess whether 85+ point pass criteria is achieved
- [ ] Create detailed gap analysis for any remaining issues

**GIT FLOW COMPLETION:**
- [ ] Commit validation results: `git add . && git commit -m "Task 04: Feature-proposal validation complete - Score: [XX]/100"`
- [ ] If score ≥85: Prepare successful merge to main
- [ ] If score <85: Document gaps and prepare improvement branch
- [ ] Update Scopecraft task with final validation score and decision

## Deliverable
Comprehensive feature-proposal validation report including:
- Complete checklist validation with all 266 criteria assessed
- Final score calculation with breakdown by category
- Comparison analysis: New score vs. original 70/100
- Detailed documentation of improvements that raised the score
- Identification of remaining gaps or critical failure points
- Pass/fail assessment against 85+ point criteria
- Specific recommendations for addressing any remaining issues
- Success confirmation or iteration requirements for next cycle

## Log
- 2025-07-03: Branch created: testing/task-04-feature-proposal-validation. Task 3 completed successfully with perfect execution of enhanced feature-proposal command. Beginning comprehensive validation against feature-proposal-command-validation-checklist.txt - this is the critical test to confirm our improvements achieved 85+/100 target vs. original 70/100.
