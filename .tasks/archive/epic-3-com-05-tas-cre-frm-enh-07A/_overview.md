## Instruction
Apply the proven enhancement framework to Command 05 (task-creation) with a specific focus on creating high-quality, executable Scopecraft tasks that developers can immediately use.

**Critical Success Criteria:**
- Created Scopecraft tasks must have complete Instruction sections with context and requirements
- Tasks must include actionable checklist items that developers can follow
- Deliverables must be clearly defined with acceptance criteria
- Tasks must be immediately executable, not empty shells
- Validation must assess the actual Scopecraft task quality, not documentation

**Key Difference from Previous Epics:**
Unlike Commands 01-04 which output documentation files, Command 05's success is measured by the quality and completeness of the Scopecraft tasks it creates. The validation must check that tasks are properly structured, actionable, and ready for developer execution.

**Strategic Goals:**
- Enhance task-creation command to produce developer-ready Scopecraft tasks
- Demonstrate framework effectiveness with focus on task content quality
- Achieve 85+ validation score based on Scopecraft task assessment
- Complete workflow chain with executable tasks, not just documentation
