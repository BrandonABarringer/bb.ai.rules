## Instruction
Create a validation checklist specifically for assessing Scopecraft task quality. Unlike previous checklists that validated documentation, this must evaluate the actual task content and developer-readiness.

**Key Requirements:**
- Focus validation on Scopecraft task sections (Instruction, Tasks, Deliverable)
- Score based on task completeness and actionability
- Penalize empty sections, placeholders, or generic content
- Reward specific, executable task content
- Include criteria for developer-readiness assessment

## Tasks
- [ ] Design 100-point scoring system for Scopecraft task quality
- [ ] Create validation criteria for Instruction completeness (25 points)
- [ ] Create validation criteria for Tasks checklist quality (35 points)
- [ ] Create validation criteria for Deliverable clarity (25 points)
- [ ] Create validation criteria for overall executability (15 points)
- [ ] Define penalties for empty sections or placeholders
- [ ] Add examples of high-scoring vs low-scoring tasks
- [ ] Include specific Scopecraft structure requirements
- [ ] Ensure validation can be applied to created tasks
- [ ] Save as task-creation-scopecraft-validation-checklist.md

## Deliverable

- Scores actual task content quality (not documentation)
- Ensures tasks have complete, actionable content
- Identifies and penalizes empty or generic sections
- Provides clear scoring criteria for each task component
- Enables objective assessment of developer-readiness
