# Validate Brainstorm Output Against Standards

---
type: feature
status: todo
area: command-validation
---


## Instruction
Conduct comprehensive validation of the brainstorm command output against standardized patterns and quality criteria to ensure our changes achieved their intended goals.

This validation will check both the process compliance (how the command was executed) and output quality (what was produced) to identify any gaps in our standardization approach.

The validation should reference existing brainstorm validation checklists if they exist, or create appropriate validation criteria based on our standardization goals.

**GIT FLOW REQUIREMENTS:**
This task continues on the testing/task-01-enhanced-brainstorm branch from the previous task, or creates a new branch if Task 1 required fixes. All validation work and results will be committed to maintain testing progression.

## Tasks
**GIT FLOW SETUP:**
- [ ] Check current branch status: `git branch`
- [ ] If on testing/task-01-enhanced-brainstorm: Continue on same branch
- [ ] If Task 1 revealed issues: Create validation branch: `git checkout -b testing/task-02-brainstorm-validation`
- [ ] Update Scopecraft task with branch strategy in log

**VALIDATION EXECUTION:**
- [ ] Check if brainstorm-command-validation-checklist.txt exists in project root
- [ ] If checklist exists, validate brainstorm output against all criteria
- [ ] If no checklist exists, create validation criteria based on standardization goals:
  - [ ] Module reference pattern usage
  - [ ] Tool usage language consistency
  - [ ] Template structure compliance
  - [ ] Integration section format
  - [ ] Extended Thinking Mode activation
  - [ ] Research validation completeness
- [ ] Score the brainstorm execution against validation criteria
- [ ] Compare performance with expected standardization improvements
- [ ] Identify specific areas where standardization worked well
- [ ] Document any areas where standardization fell short
- [ ] Assess readiness for feature-proposal handoff
- [ ] Create recommendations for brainstorm command improvements if needed

**GIT FLOW COMPLETION:**
- [ ] Commit validation results: `git add . && git commit -m "Task 02: Brainstorm validation complete - [PASS/FAIL] with [score]"`
- [ ] If validation passed: Merge to main and prepare for Task 3
- [ ] If validation failed: Document issues and create improvement plan
- [ ] Update Scopecraft task status with validation outcome and branch status

## Deliverable
Comprehensive brainstorm validation report including:
- Validation score against established or created criteria
- Detailed assessment of standardization pattern usage
- Identification of successful standardization elements
- Documentation of any gaps or issues found
- Comparison with pre-standardization expectations
- Assessment of workflow integration readiness
- Specific recommendations for improvements (if any)
- Go/no-go decision for proceeding to feature-proposal testing
