## Instruction
Execute comprehensive testing of the enhanced command framework to validate improvements and iterate until command execution meets quality standards.

This epic encompasses testing both brainstorm and feature-proposal commands with the new standardized patterns, validating against validation checklists, identifying remaining gaps, and iterating improvements until achieving target quality scores.

The testing will follow a full workflow approach: brainstorm → feature-proposal → validation → iteration → re-testing until both commands consistently score 85+/100 on their respective validation checklists.

Success criteria:
- Brainstorm command executes with standardized patterns and proper handoff preparation
- Feature-proposal command scores 85+/100 (up from original 70/100)
- Workflow integration between commands functions smoothly
- No agent confusion from conflicting patterns
- All validation gaps from original testing are resolved
