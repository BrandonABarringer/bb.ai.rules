# Baseline Test: Execute Enhanced Brainstorm Command

---
type: feature
status: todo
area: command-validation

## Instruction
Execute the enhanced brainstorm command using a new test topic to validate that standardized module reference patterns, tool usage language, and template structure alignment work correctly.

This baseline test will verify that our changes to the brainstorm command don't introduce any regressions while ensuring the new standardized patterns function as designed.

The test must use a realistic topic that will exercise all aspects of the brainstorm workflow including codebase analysis, external research, and proper handoff preparation.

## Tasks
- [ ] Select appropriate test topic for brainstorming (AI-powered code review automation system)
- [ ] Execute `/project:brainstorm AI-powered code review automation system` command
- [ ] Verify standardized module reference pattern usage during execution
- [ ] Check that "For this command:" clarifications appear and guide execution appropriately
- [ ] Confirm tool usage follows consistent language patterns (**Use [Tool] for [purpose]:**)
- [ ] Validate that Extended Thinking Mode activates with visible reasoning
- [ ] Ensure systematic baseline research executes (Grep, Glob, Read, WebSearch minimum)
- [ ] Check that optional Extended Thinking Mode Documentation section is available in template
- [ ] Verify Integration section follows standardized "Command Transition" format
- [ ] Confirm output file creation in correct directory structure
- [ ] Document any deviations from expected behavior or patterns

## Deliverable
Successfully executed brainstorm command output with:
- Proper file location: docs/outputs/sessions/[YYYY-MM-DD]/workflow-[NN]-ai-code-review/brainstorm-ai-code-review-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
- Standardized module reference usage documented
- Consistent tool usage language confirmed
- Extended Thinking Mode activation verified
- Complete research validation executed
- Proper Integration section for feature-proposal handoff
- Documentation of any issues or deviations encountered
- Baseline performance assessment for comparison with original workflow
