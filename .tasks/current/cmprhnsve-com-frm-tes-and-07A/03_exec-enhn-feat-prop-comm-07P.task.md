# Execute Enhanced Feature-Proposal Command

---
type: feature
status: todo
area: command-validation

## Instruction
Execute the enhanced feature-proposal command using the brainstorm output from the previous test to validate that all improvements (standardized patterns, enhanced validation, comprehensive documentation requirements) work correctly in the full workflow context.

This is the critical test that will determine if our improvements successfully address the original validation gaps that caused the 70/100 score.

The execution must demonstrate proper integration with the brainstorm output while showcasing all enhanced validation and documentation capabilities.

## Tasks
- [ ] Verify brainstorm output file exists and is accessible for integration
- [ ] Execute `/project:feature-proposal` command (should auto-use brainstorm primary recommendation)
- [ ] Monitor and document Extended Thinking Mode Documentation section usage
- [ ] Verify standardized module reference patterns are followed
- [ ] Confirm "For this command:" clarifications guide proper execution
- [ ] Validate mandatory tool sequence execution (Grep, Glob, Read, WebSearch minimum)
- [ ] Check that each tool use is documented with contribution analysis
- [ ] Verify brainstorm integration extracts specific quotes and references
- [ ] Ensure template structure is followed exactly with all sections populated
- [ ] Confirm feasibility matrix is completed with all scores and justifications
- [ ] Validate that comprehensive Command Execution Validation section is included
- [ ] Check that all bracketed placeholders are replaced with actual content
- [ ] Verify Integration section prepares properly for feature-to-prd handoff
- [ ] Confirm output file created with correct naming and directory structure
- [ ] Document the complete execution process and any issues encountered
