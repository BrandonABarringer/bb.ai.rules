# Execute Enhanced Feature-Proposal Command

---
type: feature
status: in_progress
area: command-validation
---


## Instruction
Execute the enhanced feature-proposal command using the brainstorm output from the previous test to validate that all improvements (standardized patterns, enhanced validation, comprehensive documentation requirements) work correctly in the full workflow context.

This is the critical test that will determine if our improvements successfully address the original validation gaps that caused the 70/100 score.

The execution must demonstrate proper integration with the brainstorm output while showcasing all enhanced validation and documentation capabilities.

**GIT FLOW REQUIREMENTS:**
This task creates a new feature branch to test the enhanced feature-proposal command. If previous tasks passed validation, this starts from main. If issues were found, this starts from the analysis branch.

## Tasks
**GIT FLOW SETUP:**
- [ ] Switch to main if previous tasks passed: `git checkout main && git merge [previous-branch]`
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b testing/task-03-enhanced-feature-proposal`
- [ ] Verify brainstorm output accessibility for integration
- [ ] Update Scopecraft task with branch info and setup status

**FEATURE-PROPOSAL EXECUTION:**
- [ ] Verify brainstorm output file exists and is accessible for integration
- [ ] Execute `/project:feature-proposal` command (should auto-use brainstorm primary recommendation)
- [ ] Monitor and document Extended Thinking Mode Documentation section usage
- [ ] Verify standardized module reference patterns are followed
- [ ] Confirm "For this command:" clarifications guide proper execution
- [ ] Validate mandatory tool sequence execution (Grep, Glob, Read, WebSearch minimum)
- [ ] Check that each tool use is documented with contribution analysis
- [ ] Verify brainstorm integration extracts specific quotes and references
- [ ] Ensure template structure is followed exactly with all sections populated
- [ ] Confirm feasibility matrix is completed with all scores and justifications
- [ ] Validate that comprehensive Command Execution Validation section is included
- [ ] Check that all bracketed placeholders are replaced with actual content
- [ ] Verify Integration section prepares properly for feature-to-prd handoff
- [ ] Confirm output file created with correct naming and directory structure
- [ ] Document the complete execution process and any issues encountered

**GIT FLOW COMPLETION:**
- [ ] Commit execution results: `git add . && git commit -m "Task 03: Enhanced feature-proposal execution complete"`
- [ ] Document execution quality and readiness for validation
- [ ] Update Scopecraft task status with execution outcome

## Deliverable
Successfully executed enhanced feature-proposal command with:
- Complete output file: docs/outputs/sessions/[YYYY-MM-DD]/workflow-[NN]-ai-code-review/feature-proposal-ai-code-review-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
- All Enhanced validation requirements met
- Extended Thinking Mode Documentation section completed
- All module access documented with Read tool usage
- All tool usage logged with contribution analysis
- Brainstorm integration with specific quotes and references
- Complete template compliance with no unfilled placeholders
- Accurate feasibility matrix calculation
- Comprehensive Command Execution Validation section included and completed
- Proper Integration section for feature-to-prd handoff
- Detailed execution log documenting improvements demonstrated

## Log
- 2025-07-03: Branch created: testing/task-03-enhanced-feature-proposal. Tasks 1-2 passed with excellent results (92/100 validation score). Beginning enhanced feature-proposal command execution - this is the critical test to validate our improvements address the original 70/100 validation gaps.
