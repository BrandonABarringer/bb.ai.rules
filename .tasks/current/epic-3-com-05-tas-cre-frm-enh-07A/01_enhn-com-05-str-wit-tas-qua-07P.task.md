- [ ] Add validation for Instruction section completeness
- [ ] Add validation for Tasks checklist actionability
- [ ] Add validation for Deliverable clarity
- [ ] Ensure no empty task shells are created
- [ ] Save enhanced command with git commit

## Deliverable
Enhanced task-creation command that produces high-quality Scopecraft tasks with:
- Complete Instruction sections providing context and requirements
- Actionable Tasks checklists developers can execute
